Tech Blog

For this assignment, We were tasked with creating a blog-type website that allows you to create an account, login/logout, and create, view and reply to blog posts. All from scratch.

### Prerequisites

I've deployed the Tech Blog to a live site using Heroku, and I've linked the live site below. So feel free to take a look, all you'll need in order to test it out is a device with internet connection and a browser.

## Getting Started

The first thing you'll see after loading up the site is a home page that looks like this:

From here, you can start viewing people's blog posts, or you can log in/sign up.

If you choose to log in/sign up, you will be presented with a page that looks like this:

Once you've logged in or created an account you can start creating blog posts, and replying to other people's blog posts.

After logging in you will be taken back to the homepage, except it will look slightly different:

As you can see from the screenshot, you now have a button available enabling you to create a new post. You can also see the navigation links on the header changed too.

If you click on one of the blog posts presented to you on the home page, you will see an expanded version of that post that looks like this:

From this page you can view replies, and if you're logged in you can add your own reply.

If you click "view replies" on a post that has no replies, you will see a message popup that looks like this:

Since this post has no replies, let's add a reply of our own. Just click add reply and you will be presented with an input form that looks like this:

Now after clicking "view replies" you will see your reply added beneath the main post:

Okay, so now you know how to view and reply to other people's posts. But how about creating your own? Well it's pretty simple. Just navigate back to the home page by clicking the "home" button, then click the "+ New Post" button. After doing that, you will be presented with an input form that looks like this:

Once you're done typing your post, just hit submit and your post will be added.

Now if you hit the navigation button on the header called "your posts" you will be presented with all the posts that you've created.

If you choose to view one of your own posts, you'll see a screen similar to what you saw when viewing someone else's posts, but with a couple of additions:

As you can see, when viewing one of your own posts, you now have the option to edit or delete that post.
