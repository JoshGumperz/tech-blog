Tech Blog

For this assignment, We were tasked with creating a blog-type website that allows you to create an account, login/logout, and create and view blog posts. All from scratch.

### Prerequisites

In order to test out the E-Commerce-Back-End, you'll need to have Node installed, you'll need to run the "npm i" command to install the necessary dependancies, and you'll need to change the information stored in the .env file to reflect your own username.password, and database. Optionally, you can run the command "npm run seed" to seed in some placeholder data.

## Getting Started

Once you've completed all the necessary prerequisites, you can start using the blog site. 


The first thing you'll wanna do after opening up your terminal is make sure you've sourced the correct database. In order to do this, you'll need to run the command "mysql -u root -p" you will then be prompted to login to your mySQL account.

Optionally, you can also run the "npm run seed" command in order to start off with some placeholder data.

Now you're ready to start making blog posts. From here, you can run the command "node server.js"

this will initialize the program, and allow you to use view the site

All that's left to do from here is test it out. Go to your browser and type in this link: "http://localhost:3001" 

Now you're all set and ready to test out the site.
